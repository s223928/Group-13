# Note 
Your delivery should tie together A3-A5 - And from a users/readers point of view we like to see dedicated references to each of the assignements’ outcomes. Therefore you may want to edit (commit changes to) the README.md in the main path of your project account to point at A3-A5 (A1-A2 is optional), or write a small intro to the Project Reflection and wrap-up that clearly links to each of the sub deliveries in those assignments.


# Your learning experience for the concept you focused on.
- Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended
- What else do you still need to learn?
- how you might use OpenBIM in the future?

Line: 
**Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended:**
At the beginning of the course, I hadn’t even opened VS Code before. I had no practical coding experience, and concepts like data extraction or using IFC commands were completely new to me. Now I can navigate code confidently, pull data from models, and work with a library of IFC commands. I also understand how these tools can be applied in practice, which has significantly increased my technical foundation.
**What else do you still need to learn?**
To get the full benefit of what I’ve learned, I still need to improve my general coding skills. I understand the concepts, but I need more routine, structure, and confidence in writing and debugging code on my own. Strengthening this will make it easier to build more advanced tools and automate larger workflows.
**How you might use OpenBIM in the future:**
The course presentations gave me a lot of inspiration for how OpenBIM can be used, and it was fascinating to see how versatile it is. I plan to use it to streamline my workflow in early design stages, where models change constantly and manual work becomes inefficient. I also see strong potential for applying it in ventilation, heat balance, and daylight calculations, where you often need to handle large amounts of simple geometry and repetitive computations. Automating these processes through OpenBIM will make my work faster, more flexible, and more consistent.


# Your process of developing the tutorial
- Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
- Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
- Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?

Line:
**Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions you might need later for your thesis?**
        Yes. The process helped me understand how to frame the right questions and identify what I need to investigate further, especially regarding data handling, automation, and how BIM tools can support early-stage design.
**Would you have preferred less choice in the use cases?**
        The large amount of freedom was a bit daunting at first, especially without supervision, and it made it easy to accidentally choose something too difficult. But the openness was also very valuable, because it allowed for a wide range of tools and approaches without a fixed standard of what “finished” had to look like. I would have liked some guidance or feedback early on to help evaluate ideas and their feasibility.
**Was the number of tools for the course okay? Should we have more or less? If so, which ones?**
        I dont understand the question.




# (As a group) summary of the feedback you received on your tutorial

- did the tool address the use case you identified?
- What stage does the tool you created work in Advanced Building Design? ( Stage A, B, C and/ or D).

# Feedback

## Presentation

### Why did it need the MEP file?
It was a leftover from the early stages of tool development. The original idea was to use the MEP model to check duct outlet sizing and outlet counts, which would have been ideal. However, as we moved deeper into the ventilation calculations, the scope became more extensive than expected. Because of that, the tool still has a lot of potential for further development and additional features.

### Could you keep the data in VS (the program) for later processing and analysis?
Yes. You would simply need to recode how the information is stored. Once adjusted, the tool could easily be expanded, or the extracted data could be reused for further analysis.

## Group feedback
- Good job building the tool. A lot of the required information can be difficult to extract or locate.
- Consider using the given occupancy data if available.
- It would be useful if the program accessed the model and informed the user whether sufficient information is available, and what data is missing.
- BCF files could be used to show errors clearly, making it easier to identify what exactly is wrong.
- Make it clear that the MEP file was originally intended for use in the code but is not actually incorporated. The current version of the tool only needs the ARCH file to function in theory.
- Using chair count for occupancy makes sense, since ventilation is typically dimensioned based on a fully occupied space.




# (Individual) Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM
- are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
- are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?

## Line:
**Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?**
I am very likely to use OpenBIM tools in my thesis. I find them extremely versatile and adaptable once you understand how they work. They are especially valuable for checking the model's level of completion, ensuring consistency in data, and streamlining long or complex processes that would otherwise be time-consuming to handle manually.
**Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professional life in the next 10 years?**
Yes. I plan to use OpenBIM regularly, as it streamlines workflows, automates repetitive tasks, and supports design and quality control. In roles like project manager or graphic communicator, these tools will be essential as the industry moves toward open, transparent data.






# (Individual) Wrap up
- conclude the journey through A1-A5

## Line:
        The assignments were fairly straightforward. As mentioned earlier, the freedom was enjoyable and allowed for a wide variety of applications, though more guidance would have been helpful. In the first part of the course, the difficulty level allowed us to work on our own projects, learn the basics individually, and deliver the best working tool.

        In the later part of the course, it was more challenging to code and integrate our different parts, especially since we often worked individually and had slightly different expectations for what the tools should achieve. It was also difficult to fully develop the tools, even with the provided library of commands, without prior coding experience. I relied on my more experienced teammates and ChatGPT for some of the more complex coding, but the experience was still valuable, and I learned a lot from understanding and editing the scripts. Overall, the course went well, and it was rewarding to create tools that could actually be used and further developed in the future.

        It was also very valuable that all projects were presented, allowing us to ask questions and learn from each other. The tutorials were particularly helpful, ensuring that we understood our tools and enabling everyone to quickly grasp their function and then ask questions to their applications, limitations, and potential for further development.

        My main criticisms of the course are the room, which was unsuitable for lectures and presentations, and the assignment descriptions. While we received a lot of information, it was sometimes difficult to clearly identify the exact deliverables.
