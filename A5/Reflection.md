# Note 
Your delivery should tie together A3-A5 - And from a users/readers point of view we like to see dedicated references to each of the assignements’ outcomes. Therefore you may want to edit (commit changes to) the README.md in the main path of your project account to point at A3-A5 (A1-A2 is optional), or write a small intro to the Project Reflection and wrap-up that clearly links to each of the sub deliveries in those assignments.


# Your learning experience for the concept you focused on.
- Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended
- What else do you still need to learn?
- how you might use OpenBIM in the future?

# Your process of developing the tutorial

- Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
- Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
- Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?

# (As a group) summary of the feedback you received on your tutorial

- did the tool address the use case you identified?
- What stage does the tool you created work in Advanced Building Design? ( Stage A, B, C and/ or D).

# feedback:
## Presentation: 
 - Why did it need the MEP file: 
        It is the remains of the early tool develupment. The original idea was to use it to check the duct outlet sizing and count that would be ideal but as we got into the detailing od ventilation calculation it got to be more exstensive then originally planned. in that way this tool also have a lot of potential for further develupment and use.

- Could you keep the data in VS(the program) so you could use it as later for further prossesing and analazis?
        Yes, you would simply have to recode how you want the information saved and you could easily develup the tool or use the data extrated further.

## Group feedback
- good job building the tool. a lot of the information can be deficult to extract/find the information.
- maybe use the occupancy given if there is any too.
- it would be cool if the program acceses the model and tell the user if it has sufficient information and what information is lacking.
- BCF files - show errors files so you can see excatly what is wrong.
- make it clear that that the MEP file was meant to be used in the code but isnt actully incoprated or used. so to be clear, the current program acctully only needs the ARCH file to work in teory.
- the occupancy based on chairs makes good sence as you would dimension the ventilation on a filled room.



# (Individual) Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM

## Dimitris:
- are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
- are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?


## Line:
Im VERY likly to use OpenBIM tools in all aspects of my future. i find it really versetile and adabtble whne you know what you are doing. esppeselly to check model level of completion and stramline long complicated processes.

## Niki:

- are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
- are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?
